### Contributing

There's a lot of interest in tinygrad lately. Here's some guidelines for contributing:

* Bugfixes are the best and always welcome!
* If you don't understand the code you are changing, don't change it!
* All code golf PRs will be closed, but conceptual cleanups are great.
* Features are welcome. Though if you are adding a feature, you need to include tests.
* Improving test coverage is great, with reliable non brittle tests.
